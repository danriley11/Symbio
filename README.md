# Hello!

I understand the task was to test my Java knowledge, however I have chosen to do it with a react.js
as i believe it's a higher priority to exemplify content/logic than to struggle using another language
which could later be learned outside the context of a test. 

## Passion & Confidence in Learning
I'm confident i'd be able to pickup other languages given the chance. I learn best through reverse-engineering
and building up from smaller components/building blocks.

## Context
Unfortunately i've only been able to work on this project across the span of a single day as i've been feeling very
unwell the past 3 days and have a sisters wedding the day after this submission. Life isn't always going to be this 
hectic however I hope it helps that i had & have every intention of completing this within and outside the alotted
time for this task. 

## Learnings from this task
1. I've learnt that breaking down a string and converting to a value can be quite tricky when also linked with comparing two sets of strings
2. Boundaries and edge-cases require testing and validation before moving on. It's easier to spend more time at the beginning than resolving bugs at the end
> However this doesn't rule out learning how to resolve earlier bugs from later code.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
